##Features:
Completed:
-As a user, I want to enter an expense, so I can keep track of where I'm spending my money. I should be able to provide a description
    (for example, "Burgers"), an amount ($7.56), and the date I made the purchase.
-As a user, I want to choose a single category for each expense, so I can label out where I'm spending my money.
-As a user, I want to filter my spending reports by time period, so that I can know how my spending habits have changed over time.
-As a user, I want to set a monthly budget for each category, so that I can create goals for my spending.


TODO:
-As a user, I want to see if I've exceeded my budget for each category, each month.
-As a user, I want to show what percentage of my money I spent in each category, so I can know where I'm wasting all of my money.
-As a user, I want to choose multiple categories for each expense, because life is not so simple.
-As a user, I want to label what company I made each purchase from, so that I can see which companies are profiting from my poor budgeting.
-As a user, I want to see what percentage of each category I spend on each company, so that I can try to figure out where to most
    easily make a dent in my spending.
